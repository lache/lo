CZMQ version 4.0.3 stable, released on 20xx/xx/xx
=================================================


CZMQ version 4.0.2 stable, released on 2016/12/31
=================================================

* Fixed #1559 - DRAFT zsock_new_*_checked symbols leak

* Fixed #1560 - zsock options could be available at build time but
                not at runtime. Added runtime check, an error will
                be printed if the option is not available.

* Fixed #1565 - improved compatibility with Solaris/Illumos

* Fixed #1573 - memory leak when message send fails in internal usage


CZMQ version 4.0.1 stable, released on 2016/11/10
=================================================

* Version 4.0.0 introduced the DRAFT mechanism, but it had a flaw:
  the internally defined DRAFT symbols were leaking as global in the
  shared library. This meant that although the API was stable, the
  ABI could in some cases not be.
  This has now been fixed using compiler's visibility attribute to
  avoid this problem.


CZMQ version 4.0.0 stable, released on 2016/11/04
=================================================

* v4.0.0 breaks API and ABI compatibility with v3.0.2.
  The ABI version has been bumped to 4.

* The v2 API, which have been declared DEPRECATED in v3.0.0
  released on 2014/10/15, have now been declared RETIRED
  and removed from this release. The following classes are gone:

  - zauth_v2, use zauth
  - zbeacon_v2, use zbeacon
  - zctx, use zsock
  - zmonitor_v2, use zmonitor
  - zmutex
  - zproxy_v2, use zproxy
  - zsocket, use zsock
  - zsockopt, use zsock
  - zthread, use zactor

  The following DEPRECATED methods have also been declared
  RETIRED and removed from their STABLE classes:

  - zcert_fprint, use zcert_print
  - zcertstore_fprint, use zcertstore_print
  - zhash_foreach (and callback), use zhash_first/next
  - zhashx_foreach (and callback), use zhashx_first/next
  - zhashx_autofree, use zhashx_set_destructor
  - zloop_ignore_interrupts, use zloop_set_nonstop
  - zpoller_ignore_interrupts, use zpoller_set_nonstop

* Some STABLE APIs unfortunately had to be slightly changed to
  fix critical issues. From v4.0.0 we commit to avoid incompatible changes
  to STABLE APIs.
  The following signatures have changed:

  - v3.0.2: byte * zarmour_decode (zarmour_t *self, const char *data, size_t *decode_size)

    zsys_auto_use_fd (see doc/zsys.txt for details)

* New DRAFT APIs early-release mechanism. New APIs will be introduced early
  in public releases, and until they are stabilized and guaranteed not to
  change anymore they will be unavailable unless the new build flag
  --enable-drafts is used. This will allow developers and early adopters to
  test new APIs before they are finalized.
  NOTE: as the name implies, NO GUARANTEE is made on the stability of these APIs.
  They might change or disappear entirely. Distributions are recommended NOT to
  build with them.

  The following DRAFT classes were added:

  - zproc
  - ztimerset
  - ztrie

  The following DRAFT methods were added to their respective STABLE class:

  - zcert_unset_meta
  - zcertstore_set_loader, zcertstore_empty
  - zframe_routing_id, zframe_set_routing_id, zframe_group, zframe_set_group
  - zhashx_unpack_own, zhashx_pack_own, zhashx_serializer_fn, zhashx_deserializer_fn
  - zmsg_routing_id, zmsg_set_routing_id
  - zstr_str

* Support for new libzmq DRAFT socket types was added to zsock. See libzmq 4.2.0
  release notes and doc/zsock.txt for more details. NOTE: until libzmq declares
  these as STABLE, the CZMQ support will be in DRAFT state as well.

* Support for all new libzmq socket and context options was added to zsock. See
  libzmq 4.2.0 release notes and doc/zsock.txt for more details.

* Many, many bug fixes. Check git log for the complete set of changes.

Added support for the new socket options:
 
 * zsocket_set_req_relaxed ()
 * zsocket_set_req_correlate ()
 * zsocket_set_conflate ()


CZMQ version 2.0.0 (rc1), released on 2013/09/19
================================================

The changes are mainly tools to support encryption via the libzmq CURVE 
mechanism, but also some new API constructs to make it simpler to do 
common messaging work.

Bug fixes and cleanups of codebase:

* zconfig_load () failed if the ZPL file contained a blank line.

* zconfig_locate () allows and ignores initial '/' on pathname.

* Added zsys_vprintf () to centralize all variable string formatting;
  this code was duplicated many times across the project.

* Updated zmsg interface documentation to be more detailed.

* Removed deprecated zstr_sendfm () method.

* Removed deprecated zstr_sendf () method.

* Removed definition of ZMQ_IGNERR and added zloop_set_tolerant ()
  to configure a specific poller as error-tolerant.
  
* Removed deprecated zframe and zmsg zero-copy methods; this API was
  too complex and split over several classes, and IMO if we want this 
  optimization it should be in a new zero-copy class with a clean API.

* Removed deprecated zsocket zero-copy methods, for above reason.

* Removed deprecated zlist_copy method.

* Renamed zframe_print_to_stream to zframe_fprint and kept old name
  as deprecated macro.

* Removed (not deprecated) zctx_set_hwm () as its semantics were not
  consistent, and confusing to people.
  
* Removed (not deprecated) zctx_hwm (). We now have separate HWMs for
  normal socket SND and RCV, and for inter-thread pipes. There is no
  need to provide accessor methods for these.
  
New API methods to simplify common messaging tasks:

* Added zpoller class to provide new minimalist interface to zmq_poll.
  This class makes it very simple to read off a set of sockets, which
  is an 80% usecase.

* Added zstr_sendx () to send multiple strings in one call. Inspired
  by PyZMQ's multipart send method.

* Added zstr_recvx () to receive multiple strings in one call. We do
  a lot of multipart string reads; this makes it simpler for simple
  cases.

* Added zclock_timestr () to provide date/time as printable string.

* Added zmsg_append () that nullifies caller's frame reference; this
  is more consistent with the API style than zmsg_add (), which is
  deprecated.
  
New classes used for security infrastructure:

* Added zchunk class (from FileMQ), for managing memory blocks. 
  This is a simpler model than zframes, which are optimized for 
  message data. 
  
* Added zhash_comment () to add comments to a serialized zhash file.

* Added zhash_refresh () to reload a backing file if modified on disk.

* Added zconfig_comment () to add comments to saved config file, and
  added code to save such comments from file when loading it.

* Moved zfile (char *filename) methods to zsys, to make place for 
  a new zfile class based on the CLASS object model. The old methods 
  are still provided but are deprecated.
  
* Added zfile class (from FileMQ), for managing files. This provides
  a rich file class with metadata and operations. This is a component
  for directory management (zdir).
  
* Added zdir class (from FileMQ), for managing directories. This lets
  us work with filesystem directories. I wanted this to be able to 
  load certificates for security authentication. 
  
* The zdir and zfile classes are slightly stripped down from their 
  FileMQ originals; no symbolic links, no directory difference tools.

* Unfortunately to keep the old zfile_size and zfile_time methods, I
  had to use zfile_cursize and zfile_modified in the new class. This
  is a little clumsy.

* Added zsys_file_modified () to return timestamp for a filename.
  
* Added zcert class to work with Curve certificates. A certificate is 
  a public + secret key pair, plus metadata like name, email, etc. and
  is saved as two files, a public text file and a secret text file.
  Certificates are stored in ZPL (ZMQ RFC 4) configuration file format.
  
* Added zauth class to automate ZAP authenticators. This class does a
  simple plug and play authentication of clients against certificates
  stored in the $HOME/.curve directory. This can be extended over time
  with other designs.
  
* Added zcertstore class to work with Curve certificate stores. This is
  a directory or in-memory store holding a set of certificates.

* Extended zsockopt generation to allow use of binary keys in CURVE
  key options (e.g. zsocket_set_curve_secretkey_bin ()).
  
* Added addons/makecert.c tool to generate CURVE certificates.

* Added examples/security directory with several examples.

CZMQ version 1.3.0 (rc), not released
=====================================


CZMQ version 1.2.0 (stable), released on 2012/08/06
===================================================

Changes
-------

* zsockopt_ functions renamed to zsocket_, for clarity. Old names are
  still provided for compatibility.

* SUB sockets are no longer subscribed to everything.

* Fixed issue CZMQ-7, wrong name used for CZMQ man page.

* Changed zsocket_connect() to return 0 or -1, since zmq_connect() now
  checks endpoints properly (issue LIBZMQ-207).

* All classes handle memory exhaustion correctly by returning an error
  instead of asserting.

* zsocket_identity implemented correctly.

* Added zctx_underlying() to provide access to low-level 0MQ context
  object, to allow manipulation for extreme cases and tests.

* For the rest, check the git history :-)


CZMQ version 1.1.0 (stable), released on 2011/08/30
===================================================

Changes
-------

* Fixed issue CZMQ-2. (https://zeromq.jira.com/browse/CZMQ-2)

* Removed unused ctx argument from zthread_new() call.

* zloop works with zmq_pollitem_t * instead of void * sockets; allows
  use of native FDs in reactor as well as 0MQ sockets.

* zloop_reader renamed to zloop_poller.

* zloop_cancel renamed to zloop_poller_end, and API changed to work with
  zmq_pollitem_t * instead of a single 0MQ socket void *.

* Added zloop_timer_end, taking same argument as for zloop_timer.

* zloop_poller_end cancels ALL handlers for the socket or FD.

* Added zmsg_content_size method to report full content size of message.

* zmsg_save returns 0/-1 depending on success/failure (previously returned
  void).

* zmsg_dump limited to first 10 frames, to allow mix of large and small
  messages in applications.

* zframe_print truncates output at 70 chars to prevent over-long output.

* Added ability for zsocket_bind to bind to ephemeral port in range 0xc000
  to 0xffff.

* zmq_bind always returns port number bound to, if successful.

* Added zfile class with minimal helper functions.

* Added zfile_size method to return file size, as ssize_t.

* Added socket multipart flush to zctx_destroy to work around libzmq issue
  134, which asserts if a fair-queuing socket still has input at close.

* Added zframe_eq method to compare two frames' size and content.

* Changed zmsg_load to append to an optional existing message.

* Fixed zloop to allow timers to be added after reactor was started.
  Without this fix, the reactor would spin at max speed instead of
  properly calculating the timer. (Luc Heinrich)

* Modified zmsg_pushstr and zmsg_addstr to accept variable argument list
  and do vsnprintf formatting of provided string.

* Added zhash_rename function to allow soft renaming of item keys.

* Added tblsize and tbllast macros, so very useful when you need them.

* Added zmsg_encode and zmsg_decode functions to serialize messages to
  and from a byte buffer.

* Added zframe_recv_nowait method to read frame without blocking.


CZMQ version 1.0.0 (stable), released on 2011/04/26

* Fixed zloop to call right handlers even if handlers register/cancel
  other handlers.

* Fixed zloop to not call handlers when interrupted.

* Added zsocket_set_hwm method to emulate 2.x option (sets both send
  and recv high-water marks).

* Several parts of the 3.0 porting didn't work properly - fixed.

* Added macro set to aid portability from 2.1 to 3.0: ZMQ_POLL_MSEC,
  ZMQ_DONTWAIT, zmq_sendmsg, zmq_recvmsg.
